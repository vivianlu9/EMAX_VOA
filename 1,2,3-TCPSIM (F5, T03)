Make sure to use [method]A for running BFB and [method] for everything else (ex: VOF5J06A for tune check, VOF5J06 for ICAL/QC/samples)

For 25mL:
- 25mL water
- 1.0uL TCPSIM IS/SS (2.5ppm)
- 1.0uL TCPSIM (1°) (2.5ppm)
- 1.0uL TCPSIM (2°) (2.5ppm)
- Sometimes the SS fails high in QC so keep an eye on that (aim for 89-112).
- If SS fails high, rerun the sample. If it fails high again and there's no hits, report original run.

For 5.0g:
- Ask Diem
