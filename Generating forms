How to generate forms for project folders before second review (also called processing folders). This assumes you know how to process an ICAL. All commands should be run in Command Prompt.
  ** Note: The program can only process Command Prompt lines in Windows XP. If you're using the computer in the office to generate forms, you need to log into the Virtual PC (which may require special permissions). Ask me if you need to use that.

*Copying RR files*
1. Get a floppy disk or a USB stick (depends on the computer you're copying data from)
2. Copy the RR files for the data you're reporting (ONLY copy the RR files you need; do NOT copy extra files or else you'll have problems with processing forms later)
  ** The files you're copying should be highlighted in the run log. Make sure you also check the run log for discrepancies so they can be fixed before second review.
3. Alternatively, you can copy the RR files from the lab backup (\\towin2003s01\LabBkup\HpChem_VOA) BUT you need to be careful checking the forms later if you do this because sometimes the RR files from the backup have different values from the actual printout

*Creating folders*
1. Go to the R: drive
2. Create a folder for the SDG if one hasn't already been made (type MKDIR [SDG number] in Command Prompt after moving to R: drive)
3. Create a folder for the method you're generating forms for (the project code for the specific analysis can be found at the top of the page containing the target list)
4. Transfer the RR files from the storage device to the method folder

*Preparing forms for processing*
Before you start any form generation, you need to generate a .CCL file for all the DCCs that were reported for the folder. To do this:
1. Go to the ICAL folder for the instrument being reported from
2. Copy the RR files for all DCCs (beginning and ending, if applicable) run using that instrument's ICAL to the ICAL folder
3. Open a second Command Prompt window and move to the ICAL folder
4. Run GCMSCCL3
5. When it asks for CCV, input all file names for the DCCs being reported
6. Copy all the .CCL files back to the method folder
  **Optional: Delete or move the DCC RR files to a new folder in the ICAL. I tend to delete them because I think the ICAL folder gets messy if you don't, but if you're reporting multiple SDGs from a single day it may be easier to keep the .CCL files to copy later.
7. Do not close the ICAL folder yet; you will need to copy the midpoint RR file later

Generating PBATCH.CSV:
**This step is ONLY for soil folders. If you're generating forms for water analysis you don't need to do this.**
1. Open a new Notepad file and save it as PBATCH.CSV
2. Copy the names of all preservation logs being reported for the folder (ex: 22VPK002.CSV)
  **Each .CSV should be a single line in the text file

Note: Make sure you have the VOLUME2 drive mapped on your account before processing the forms or else Form 1 will fail (SOIL ONLY) because the program won't know where to go to access the preservation log .CSV files. To do so: 
1. Go to \\TOWIN2003S01\VOLUME2
2. In the top bar, go to Tools > Map Network Drive
3. Specify a drive letter (can use any letter that's not already being used; I tend to default to X:)
4. Specify the folder you want to map (\\TOWIN2003S01\VOLUME2)

*Generating forms:*
1. Run VOF1 (this generates the forms that show target analyte recovery vs. the PSR as well as surrogate recoveries)
  ** Follow the prompts. If everything is copied correctly, the program should generate the forms automatically.
  ** FOR SOIL ONLY: if processing a soil folder that had EXTRA methanol dilutions (J, K, etc.), there will be an prompt where you need to add extra lines for methanol in the PREP.DAT file so the program knows to process the extra diltuions. In general though, just leave the soil folders for Bill to process.
2. Run F1P ONLY if the folder has dilutions (this generates a form that combines the data from the inital run and dilution(s), if applicable)
3. Run VOF3 (this generates the forms that show LCS/LCSD and M/S recoveries vs. the PSR)
  ** If only reporting one LCS for the day, just leave the folder for Bill to process. You'll probably get an error when trying to generate the form and idk how to fix that.
3. Copy the RR file for the ICAL midpoint to the method folder
  ** Do NOT do this before running VOF1 or else you'll get an error when trying to run the command. Alternatively, move the midpoint RR file to a new folder inside the method folder, then move it back out once you run VOF1.
4. Run VOF5F8 (this generates the forms that show BFB injection time/recoveries/analysis times as well as the form that shows IS recoveries for all data being reported that day)
Run LABCHRN1 (this generates a form that summarizes the samples and LCB data that was run for each day as well as denotes samples analyzed on different instruments, if applicable)
  ** When it asks for method, input the name of the method folder.

*Printing forms:*
1. Run VSET, then set the orientation to P and the lines to either 90 or 110 (depends on how long the target list is; you may need to adjust as needed)
2. Print Form 1 files
  ** Normally when I print the Form 1 files I use the command VPRINT [SDG letter].txt so it doesn't end up printing too many extra pages we don't need.
  ** You don't need to print Form 1 for the L, C, M or S.
  ** If you ran F1P, print the .P form too (VPRINT *.P)
3. Print Form 3 files (VPRINT *.LD1 and VPRINT *.SD1)
4. Print Form 1 for the instrument blank (ex: VPRINT VO67K06B.TXT)
5. Print F5*.*
6. Print F8*.*
7. Run VSET, then set the orientation to L and the lines to 70
8. Print *.CHR
  ** The lab chronicle sheet should always be printed horizontally. The information won't fit if printed vertically.

*Placing forms:*
1. Form 1 goes in front of each sample being reported
  ** If there is a .P form, place that in front of Form 1 for the sample's initial run.
2. Form 3 goes behind the QC Summaries divider
  ** Place the Form 1 for the instrument blank before the .LD1 form.
  ** If applicable, .SD1 form(s) go behind the .LD1 form(s). Place the M/S summaries in QC Data.
3. Place F5 and F8 forms in front of the corresponding runs under Daily Calibrations.
  ** You don't need to print the .CCL files for the DCCs.
4. The lab chronicle sheet goes on top of everything
5. Place all of the run logs behind the Analytical Logs divider
  ** This includes the run log(s) for the ICAL(s).
6. Initial the front of the folder with the date you processed the folder, then bring the folder to Data Entry for second review.
