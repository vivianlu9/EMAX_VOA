For 25mL:
- 25mL water
- 5.0uL 1,4-diox IS/SS
- 5.0uL 1,4-diox (1°)
- 5.0uL 1,4-diox (2°)

For 5.0g:
- 15mL water in 5.0g NaHSO4 (if samples are preserved)
- 15mL water (if samples are frozen)
- 4.0uL 1,4-diox IS/SS
- 4.0uL 1,4-diox (1°)
- 4.0uL 1,4-diox (2°)
- Need to run LOD/LOQ for each run (1.0ppb / 2.0ppb)
  - Spike 0.1uL and 0.2uL respectively (1° or 2° doesn't matter)
- Add 10mL of water to samples (samples have 5.0mL water already)
