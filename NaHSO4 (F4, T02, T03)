Running NaHSO4 (sodium bisulfate):
- Mostly the same standards as 25mL 8260 *except* for 8260 (1°, 2°) and 4add (1°)
  - Use the 8260 specifically labeled (SOIL); usually in the small tray in the back corner of the standards freezer
  - The concentration for 2-butanol is different for soil vs. water; largely irrelevant unless the folder specifically has 2-butanol as a target
  - All standards are spiked at the same amounts as regular 25mL 8260
- Use NaHSO4 vials for all QC/ICAL
  - Imelda has a box of vials with 5.0g NaHSO4 and a stir bar preweighed
  - If you need more vials, ask Ethan to weigh some out
- Make sure the samples have a weight log *before* analyzing
  - We only get two vials for analysis, so it's *really* important for them to not go to waste
  - If running M/S, try to make sure the M/S weights are as close as possible (swap vials around and relabel the weight log if needed)
  - Generate a .CSV file for the weight log before submitting the folder so Bill can process it without needing to make a detour
- All other procedures are the same as 25mL 8260
