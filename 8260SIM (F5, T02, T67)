For 25mL:
- 25mL water
- 2.5uL SIM IS/SS
- 2.5uL SIM (1°)
- 2.5uL SIM (2°)
- Do NOT use SmartWater when running ICAL; use DI water (m,p-xylene recovery gets affected or something if you use SmartWater).
- To see if a folder is 8260SIM or TCPSIM, check the surrogates.
  - If the folder has d4 or 4BFB as a target surrogate, run as 8260SIM.
  - If the folder has d8 as a target surrogate, run as TCPSIM.
- If running on T67, need to run LOD/LOQ for every run.
