Make sure to use [method]A for running BFB and [method] for everything else (ex: VOF5J06A for tune check, VOF5J06 for ICAL/QC/samples)

For 25mL:
- 25mL water
- 2.5uL SIM IS/SS (5.0ppm)
- 2.5uL SIM (1°) (5.0ppm)
- 2.5uL SIM (2°) (5.0ppm)
- Do NOT use SmartWater when running ICAL; use DI water (m,p-xylene recovery gets affected or something if you use SmartWater)
- To see if a folder is 8260SIM or TCPSIM, check the surrogates
  - If the folder has d4 or 4BFB as a target surrogate, run as 8260SIM
  - If the folder has d8 as a target surrogate, run as TCPSIM
- If running on T67, need to run LOD/LOQ for every run

For 5.0g:
- Ask Imelda
