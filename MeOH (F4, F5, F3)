Running MeOH:
- Mostly the same standards as 25mL 8260 *except* for 8260 (1°, 2°) and 4add (1°)
  - Use the 8260 specifically labeled (SOIL); usually in the small tray in the back corner of the standards freezer
  - The concentration for 2-butanol is different for soil vs. water; largely irrelevant unless the folder specifically has 2-butanol as a target
  - All standards are spiked at the same amounts as regular 25mL 8260
- Need total of 100uL MeOH in *all* QC/ICAL
  - Spike 100uL of *clean* MeOH in all QC
  - Manually calculate amount of MeOH needed to reach 100uL total in ICAL (usually only have to do this after midpoint level)
- Make sure the samples have a weight log *before* analyzing
  - If you can't find the sample in the fridge, you probably need to ask Ethan to get it from the sample storage room and he'll need to prepare it
  - If the folder says product, analyze as MeOH sample
  - If the folder says sludge, analyze as 8260 5.0g first and MeOH later *only* if the 5.0g analysis fails
  - Generate a .CSV file for the weight log before submitting the folder so Bill can process it without needing to make a detour
- All other procedures are the same as 25mL 8260

Spiking MeOH (same for all instruments):
- 5.0uL IS/SS (50ppm)
- 15mL water (F3, F4)
- 10mL water (F5)

1°:
- 5.0uL 8260 (50/500ppm)
- 5.0uL KET-AA (250ppm)
- 1.0uL 4 ADD (250/500ppm)
- 1.0uL GAS (250ppm)
- 1.0uL CS2 (250ppm)
- 1.0uL FREON (250ppm)

2°:
- 5.0uL 8260 (50/500ppm)
- 5.0uL KET-AA (250ppm)
- 5.0uL 3 ADD (50ppm)
- 5.0uL 2-butanol (500ppm)
- 1.0uL GAS (250ppm)
- 1.0uL CS2 (250ppm)
- 1.0uL FREON (250ppm)
