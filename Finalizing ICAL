Steps to finalizing an ICAL.

1. Copy RR files and LIST.TXT (can be found under the Method folder on your instrument; usually under C:\HPCHEM\1\METHODS)
  ** Make sure you also generated an RR file for the BFB tune.
  ** Only copy the RR files you need. Extra RR files will cause the last step to fail.
2. Create new folder in ICAL directory under R: drive (R:\CAL\8260\[YEAR]\[ICAL NAME])
3. Move RR files and LIST.TXT to ICAL folder
  ** Important to copy the LIST.TXT file or else the last step won't work.
4. Copy [ICAL NAME].ICL from the previous ICAL
  ** This .ICL file tells the program the amount of levels, amount of compounds, concentrations, and special multipliers for the compounds in the ICAL. We generally assume the ICAL was run the same way every time, but if you ran the ICAL differently, you need to adjust the values in this file to reflect the differences in your ICAL.
    (Ex: Instead of running ten levels, you're only reporting nine because one level was bad so you removed it. You have to go into the .ICL file and delete the corresponding level from the line specifying the concentrations and specify that the ICAL only has nine levels vs. ten.)
  ** The layout of the .ICL file is as follows:
      Line 1: ICAL file name (this should be changed to match the ICAL, but nothing happens if you don't)
      Line 2: Specifies the expected values for the ICAL (this is what you would adjust if the amount of levels run ≠ expected amount)
              [amount of levels in ICAL], [amount of compounds in list], [special multipliers *], [special multipliers **], ["concentration units"]
              (Special multipliers ** is always 0, not really sure what it refers to tbh)
      Line 3: Concentrations of each level in ICAL (this is what you delete if you end up not reporting a specific level or something)
      Line 4-onwards: [List compound number], [multiplier], ["compound name" (as spelled *exactly* in the List Compounds)]
              (You don't usually need to touch this; it's very rarely that this section gets adjustments)
5. Copy levels.xslx from previous ICAL (or open a new spreadsheet in Excel)
6. Label columns corresponding to levels where you deleted compounds
7. In each column, type out the compound numbers that were deleted from the ICAL, then SAVE
8. Run GCMSICL2
    ** Follow prompts as needed.
    ** When it asks you which compounds you're deleting from a specific level, copy the corresponding column from the Excel sheet (copy the values EXACTLY; if you copy any extra cells the program will automatically skip to the end), right-click on the header in Command Prompt (the blue bar), then go to Edit > Paste
9. Open the [RR].ICL file that was generated
  ** You may need to change the name of the .ICL file to match the midpoint if you have an uneven amount of levels in your ICAL. If you do, also make sure to change it in the header of the .ICL file.
  ** If your ICAL levels were run out of order (ex: you reran a level at the end) then the beginning/end times at the header may also be incorrect. Make sure you adjust the times if needed. The beginning/end times are the times the first/last ICAL levels were ANALYZED, regardless of what order they are in the actual ICAL.
10. Check the %RSD and AV_RRF values to make sure they match the values generated in ChemStation
  ** If the values don't match, that most likely means the responses inputted in the ICAL ≠ the responses generated in the RR files. Usually that occurs because you inputted the responses BEFORE you requanted the levels. Make sure you requant the levels before replacing the responses to reduce the likelihood of this happening.
  ** Go through the entire list before you go back to make adjustments. If only one or two compounds have incorrect values, I usually manually adjust those instead of clearing/replacing all of the responses.
  ** To manually adjust responses, I go to the specific compound entry on ChemStation, go to the responses page, then write down the responses for each level. Then I'll manually check the responses for that compound in each level to make sure the values are matching. If they don't match, I write down the new value next to the old one and replace them at the end. I only do this if it's maybe one or two mismatches out of the entire list. If more than three-four don't match, I'll clear the responses and redo everything.
10. Run GCMSCCL3
    ** Follow prompts as needed. Make sure to input ALL ICV files, if applicable. Any compounds that aren't being evaluated NEED to be deleted from the data before generating the RR file. 
    ** If you ran a second ICV to verify a specific compound(s), you need to delete ALL compounds from the analysis EXCEPT for the one(s) you're verifying.
11. Run DEMO2F
    ** This command throws an error message. This is normal.
12. Run ICLRECN
    ** This generates a sheet calculating the percent recovery of all analytes in the ICAL. The percent recovery for ALL responses in the ICAL need to be 70-130 for a compound to qualify for 8260C. 
    ** It is possible for an ICAL to be invalid for 8260C for specific compounds only. Be careful when checking the target list for folders requiring 8260C if you know your ICAL isn't valid for every compound.
    ** Some compounds (ex: 1,4-dioxane, tert-butyl alcohol) don't calculate correctly when you generate the report. The percent recoveries also don't calculate correctly if the compound has a linear or quadratic curve. You need to manually calculate the recoveries in those situations.
13. Run ICALMAX (ONLY do this step if you have a quadratic curve for any of your compounds)
    ** The program is VERY specific when asking for the path. You NEED to add the \ at the end when specifying the path.
        (Ex: R:\CAL\8260\[YEAR]\[ICAL NAME] will NOT work because you need the \ at the end. The correct way to type it is R:\CAL\8260\[YEAR]\[ICAL NAME]\)
14. Run VOF5F8
    ** This will generate Form 5 for your ICAL, which shows the BFB injection time, tune values, and the samples you ran using that BFB (aka your ICAL).
    ** The last line of Form 5 will always copy the last ICAL level you ran (ex: your last ICAL level was VSTD100, so the line for your ICV will also say VSTD100). You need to manually adjust the value to match the concentration of the last run on the form (so if the ICV says VSTD100, you need to edit it to say VSTD10).
15. Run VSET, set orientation to P, then set lines to 110-128 (dependent on how many compounds are in your list and how many linear/quadratic compounds you have)
16. Run VPRINT R*.ICL
    ** Specifying the letter before .ICL will print only the midpoint .ICL file instead of both ICL files.
    ** Try to get this to print on one sheet if possible. You may need to delete empty lines to squeeze everything down to one page.
17. Run VPRINT *.CCL
18. Run VPRINT *.PER
19. Run VPRINT *.MAX (if applicable)
    ** .MAX should be printed horizontally (set orientation to L, set lines to 70). Printing it vertically causes the lines to get cut off.
